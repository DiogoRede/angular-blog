        "description": 'The Angular community has asked for an intuitive, built-in method to lazy load components, directives, and pipes. In Angular v17, we‚Äôve created Deferrable Views, a new feature that will make the process of defer loading dependencies significantly more intuitive. We built the deferrable views feature alongside the new control flow syntax using the same ‚Äú@-syntax‚Äù. Our goal is for it to be ergonomic and familiar when using this new syntax in your component templates.'
